Media’s portrayal of women and girls has the potential to shape cultural norms and expectations on gender’s role in society, potentially excluding women from full and effective participation in public life. This can be seen through portrayal of women as care-givers, victims, or dependents, in contrast to men’s portrayal as professional, independent leaders. The Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP)’s latest preliminary results have highlighted that – despite some progress – news media remains a far from equal space for women and historically marginalised groups. Despite this, the project reported that at present 48% of televised news is being reported by women, an increase on 38% in 2015. However, in 80 out of the 100 countries analysed as part of the project, women were sorely lacking as sources and subjects in the news – making women’s voices significantly underrepresented in world news.

From an advertising perspective, Melanie Tobal, Founder of Publicitarias.org, noted that marketing teams regularly view gender stereotyping as merely a trend, something to consider in the production of content or to discuss briefly in workshops. 

When considering regulations to counter gender stereotyping in media, it is imperative that they do not infringe on other human rights, particularly the right to freedom of opinion and expression. However, there is potential for regulatory framework to play a key role in challenging stereotyping and its negative impact on women and girls. 

 Furthering this, regulatory frameworks can be developed to introduce common definitions of hate-speech against women and girls and, as a result, can see the introduction of common sanctions for those who commit hate-speech.
 
 As an example, the EU’s Audiovisual Media Service Directive ensures that broadcasts in all EU Member States do not contain content which incites hatred or violence on grounds of race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation.
